# Foundry VTT Game Compendium GitHub Action Lifecycle
#
# 1. Repo owner creates a new release on the repo
# 2. Action starts, checks out code from repo

# 3. Action gets the latest wiki pages using mwclient
# 3. Action stores the titles of the wiki pages
# 4. Action splits the wiki pages into sections
# 5. Action counts the number of tokens in each section
# 6. Action filters out irrelevant sections
# 7. Action creates an embedding for each section and enters it into the database
# 8. For each title in the titles list, Action queries the OpenAI API using title and provided JSON template
